# Camera Obscura

> The photographer’s way of seeing is reflected in his choice of subject. The painter’s way of seeing is reconstituted by the marks he makes on the canvas or paper. Yet, although every image embodies a way of seeing, our perception or appreciation of an image depends also upon our own way of seeing.

— John Berger

### Showing data

[] Make a helper that compares years (including ranges of `startYear` to `endYear`) across data files and makes a list of years from that
[] Use that list to architect the 'spine' of the index page
[] Have Archibald and Event data unfurl on either side of that spine accordingly

### Styling

[] Prototype horizontal layout
