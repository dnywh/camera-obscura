    <p>It took about another 100 years from that selfie moment for cameras and their output to be accessible to the
      masses. Before that, portraiture painting was one of the few mediums available for recording and preserving people
      (and their character). Its output scale of one, the skill needed (to do a good job), and cost of materials made
      painting portraits scarce, expensive, and available to just a few.</p>

    <p>I'm writing this at the end of year 2020 CE. Given you have access to this article* (*and therefore in access of
      an
      internet-connected device, with most importantly, a screen (and perhaps a camera), you probably know all of the
      the
      above innately.</p>

      You also understand the contextual differences between these two portraits. One is of someone important;
      laboriously painted by a master, and probably kept somewhere safe without flash photography or sunlight. The other
      is a spontaneous, hastily-shot photo* from a cheap (perhaps disposable) camera; printed at Kmart, and dogeared
      from years of wallet-living. (*you can decide who is the important one...)
    </p>
    <p>If you're like me however, you may not have considered that the 'switch' from portraiture to photography (as the
      main method to record and preserve memories of people) <strong>is actually an ever-evolving relationship</strong>.
      In the age
      of
      FaceTune and on the cusp of Deepfake, photos can no longer be assumed to be an objective record. Nor could they
      ever
      be.</p>

          <span>Every image embodies a way of seeing. Even a photograph. For photographs are not, as is
often assumed, a mechanical record. Every time we look at a photograph, we are aware, however slightly, of the photographer selecting that sight from an infinity of other possible sights</span>. This is true even in the most casual family snapshot. <span>The photographer’s way of seeing is reflected in his choice of subject. The painter’s way of seeing is reconstituted by the marks he makes on the canvas or paper</span>. Yet, although every image embodies a way of seeing, our perception or appreciation of an image depends also upon our own way of seeing.</p>
